	* Very minor HTML validation tweak

	Release FeedFressReview 2.0.4:
	* Do not use the site's favicon by default, simplepie's support is not yet reliable enough, and causes timeouts and other problems.
	* Make the source feed label more easily targetable in CSS.

2007-02-19 Benoit Gregoire  <bock@step.polymtl.ca>
	Release FeedFressReview 2.0.3:
	* Fix a bug where items without a date would have the unix epoch as date on some PHP versions
	* Fix html markup error when ordering by source.  Probably still won't validate, but at least won't break list nesting

2006-12-05 Benoit Grégoire  <bock@step.polymtl.ca>
	Release FeedFressReview 2.0.2:
	* Fix a bug where all items would be displayed (instead of none)
	 if all items were past	setConfigMaxItemAge()

	* At long last, commit the completely redone, documented, FeedPressReview.  New features too numerous to list, but a few higlights:
	-Now based on SimplePie http://simplepie.org/
	-Now unobtrusively displays almost all item and feed metadata
	-Supports images
	-Supports podcasts and enclosures
	-More accurate algorithm
	-Criteria based default feed expansion
	-Full localization support (even plural forms)

	* Commit the original, Magpie-based RssPressReview 1.0 to SVN
